:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Teamwork and its open source projects.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.


## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Atom. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.


### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you want to read about using Atom or developing packages in Atom, the [Atom Flight Manual](http://flight-manual.atom.io) is free and available online. You can find the source to the manual in [atom/flight-manual.atom.io](https://github.com/atom/flight-manual.atom.io).
